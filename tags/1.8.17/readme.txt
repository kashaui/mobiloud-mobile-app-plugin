== Description ==

= Build your own mobile app =
With Mobiloud it's really easy to transform your WordPress site into beautiful, fast mobile apps that your readers and customers will love.

Give your mobile users easy access to your content and impress them with the best mobile user experience available.

= Build your own native iOS and Android apps like Techcrunch or Buzzfeed =
Mobile is huge. And growing. Smartphones and tablets are outselling PCs 4:1. Chances are you're getting 30-40% of your traffic from mobile devices today, rest assured, by 2015 it will be 50-60%. In short, your need to be on mobile if you want to be where your readers are.

Mobile users spend 80% of their time inside apps. Users love the simplicty, speed and comfort apps can offer. With Mobiloud you can finally build native mobile apps for your blog, apps which are as good as those published by popular blogs Techcrunch and Buzzfeed.

= Publish real native apps with no programming =
With Mobiloud, you can create apps without any of the programming hassle. With Mobiloud's app builder it is incredibly easy to design your app's launch screen and interface. This is **your branded mobile app**, so make it really yours!  

= Offer the best mobile user experience =
Your app will be a **real native mobile app**. We're talking about a clean, shiny design, easy swipe actions to navigate your content and one-tap access to features like favourite articles, commenting and sharing. Mobiloud apps are nothing like what our competitors offer, which are slow, poorly designed apps made using HTML.

= Have your visitors come back, again and again! =
With your own mobile app, you can convert casual visitors into loyal followers that stick and come back to your content. It's like a newsletter on steroids. **Send push notifications** to bring your mobile users back and keep them engaged. You'll notice more repeated visits!

= Increase your mobile traffic =
The experience in a mobile app is so good that mobile users tend to consume on average more content every time they load an app, compared to a desktop or mobile site (we see 5x more views/visit on apps). Your mobile app will also be featured in the App Store and Google's Play Store, giving you access to millions of mobile app users from right around the world.

= Make money with mobile advertising =
We support Google's Admob out of the box, the most popular mobile advertising solution, but you can add any HTML code to display your banners! And you can also sell the app if you wish.

= Make it simple to share your content =
To grow your site and business, sharing is everything. It's like free marketing! And with your mobile app, you'll encourage **sharing with a single tap** via social media sites or email – simple!

= App analytics =
With support for Google Analytics, you will be able to **track downloads, usage, and other statistics** in real time – so you’ll have complete visibility and transparency over the success of your mobile app.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I build a mobile app for my blog? =
More and more, people are choosing to use their smartphones and tablets to read online content. Not only these devices make reading more comfortable, which explains why people prefer them to PCs, but there are now millions of mobile users who have just started accessing online content, as they never really used a PC before. On these mobile devices, users spend 80% of their time on apps. So no wonder, they expect to find your content in the form of a mobile app!

With a mobile app you'll be able to convert casual visitors into loyal followers. Why? Because your app will be front and center, easily accessible from the home screen of their device. And because you can alert with push notifications whenever you post something new.

= What is a native mobile app? =
Mobiloud apps, on every platform, are native mobile apps. Most competing solutions instead give you HTML5 apps, which means really mobile sites re-packaged as apps. The big difference is in performance and user experience.

Native apps are fast, run smoothly on the devices they are designed for, and make full use of each platform's capabilities. They're also easier to use, because they're designed to look and feel familiar on each mobile platform, be it iOS or Android. A Mobiloud app allows your users to receive push notifications, share with a single tap, quickly comment on articles and access content offline. In short, if you want to impress your users, go native and build a real mobile app!

= Do I need to know how to code? =
No, no programming required! With Mobiloud you design and build your mobile app online, using our simple Configurator. Content comes automatically from your WordPress site.

= Do I need a designer? =
Not really! With Mobiloud's Configurator you can create your own unique app design by selecting colors, choosing background templates and uploading your logo or images, it's really simple and you can get a great result in a few minutes. If you can design with Photoshop, though, or have a designer who can help you out, you can also upload your own custom images for icon and launch screens.

= How much does it cost? =
The Mobile App Plugin is free to install. You can also design your own app at no cost and with no risk. Once you have designed your app and would like to publish it on the App Store, we have simple pricing plans you can choose from. Check the [pricing plans on Mobiloud.com](http://www.mobiloud.com/pricing.php?ref=plugindesc).

= Does Mobiloud help me build a mobile site? =
We don't provide a mobile site together with your app. It's a good idea to have a mobile site, so casual visitors can still have a decent experience on your site when using a mobile device. Of course, we recommend you also build a mobile app, to convert those casual visitors into loyal followers, increase your traffic and keep growing your audience.

The following plugins are all compatible with Mobiloud: WP-Touch, WordPress Mobile Edition, WordPress Mobile Pack, Mobile Press.

= What functionality will my mobile app offer? =
Your app will automatically show the latest content from your site, with no need for you to update it manually. Your app will display posts and pages and optionally your Twitter and Facebook profile's content. Your users will be able to read content online and offline, share it with a single tap, save their favourites, leave comments on your articles and, most importantly, receive push notifications alerting them to new content.

= Can I test out my app online before I buy? =
Yes, after installing the plugin, start designing your app and you can quickly get a live preview of your app over the web. You can also try our [example application](http://mobiloud.com/demo.php) to get a feel of how Mobiloud apps work.

= Can I try an example app on my iPhone or iPad? =
Sure, we have published many apps you can try directly. Just open up App Store on your phone or iPad and search for *9clouds*, *Armenian Weekly* or *Cardinal Connect*.

Check out the [Examples page](http://mobiloud.com/examples.php) on our site for more apps to try.

= Can I have advertising on my app? =
Of course! We support **Admob and Adwords**, out of the box. You can also add your own code for HTML banners.

= Can you add more functionality to the app? =
Yes, we can easily integrate additional content or functionality in your app, such as your Twitter feed, podcast, image or video galleries. Get in touch at [hello@mobiloud.com](mailto:hello@mobiloud.com) to get a quote.

= Can you design my app for me? =
Yes, we offer a VIP setup option which includes icon and app design, with 2 revisions from our designers. Just email us at [design@mobiloud.com](mailto:design@mobiloud.com) for a quote.

= Can I use Disqus or Facebook comments? =
Yes, you can use Disqus or Facebook for comments on your app to replace the standard Wordpress commenting system.

= Can I use my own Apple account? =
Yes, we recommend you register your own Apple developer account, though it's not requried. You can get yours [here](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/).

= How can I get a refund? =
Just email us at [support@mobiloud.com](mailto:support@mobiloud.com) and request a refund. You have 30 days since your sign up to get a full refund, no questions answered.
