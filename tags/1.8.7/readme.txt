= The Benefits: =
= Your brand on mobile =
With Mobiloud, you can create the mobile app you’ve always dreamed of without any of the programming hassle. Your WordPress site and your brand will be entirely transformed into a mobile app – it is incredibly easy to change the design of your splash screen, icons, and app user interface. This is your branded app, and you can make it yours!

= Your visitors will come back… again and again! =
With your customised app, you will be presented with new and exciting ways to engage and communicate with your readers, and vitally, new ways to keep them coming back time after time. With your app, you’ll be able to send push notifications, giving you the chance to engage your readers in a way that is far more compelling than newsletters and RSS feeds.

= Achieve sky-high app traffic =
The ease at which users can swipe through articles using a mobile app means that apps are now an essential tool for growing online traffic. App users look at around 3 articles each time they load an app, so pushing out your content via this medium will send your traffic soaring like never before. Plus, your app will be featured in the app store, providing visibility to millions of app users from right around the world.

= Making your content super simple to share =
In the online world, sharing is everything. And with your iPhone or iPad app, you will be able to encourage sharing at a tap of a Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, or Pinterest icon – simple!

= Make money from your app =
Advertising on apps generate over three times more clicks than traditional online advertising - throw paid downloads, subscriptions and purchases for premium content into the mix.

= App analytics =
With support for Google Analytics, you will be able to track downloads, usage, and other statistics relating to your mobile app in real time – so you’ll have complete visibility and transparency over the success of your stunning mobile app.

There has never been a better time to launch an app into the mobile app market, so why waste time? Design your app at <a href="http://www.mobiloud.com">Mobiloud.com</a> today. For any further questions relating to Mobiloud, don’t hesitate to get in touch with the Mobiloud team at <a href="mailto:support@mobiloud.com">support@mobiloud.com</a>

== Installation ==

1. Install the Mobiloud Mobile App Plugin either via the WordPress.org Plugin Directory, or by uploading the files to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu on WordPress.

3. That’s it! Your WordPress blog is ready to start providing content to your Mobiloud app.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have the plugin, how do I get my app? =

To get started with Mobiloud, visit <a href="http://app.mobiloud.com">http://app.mobiloud.com</a> and start designing your own app. More information on our service is available at <a href="http://www.mobiloud.com">http://www.mobiloud.com</a>.

= How much is the service? =

The Mobile App Plugin is free to install. You can also design your own app at no cost and with no risk. 

Once you have designed your app and would like to publish it on the App Store, we have two simple plans. <strong>Professional</strong>, at $49/month, gets you an iPhone app and up to 1,000 push notifications a month. Our <strong>Publisher</strong> plan, at $69 a month, gives you an iPhone and iPad app and unlimited push notifications. Support and maintenance are included in both plans.

= What functionality will my app offer? =

Your app will gather content automatically from your Wordpress site, display posts and pages and optionally your Twitter and Facebook profile's content. Your users will be able to read content online and offline, share it with a single tap, save their favourites, leave comments on your articles and receive push notifications alerting them to new content.

= Can you add more functionality to the app? =

Sure, we can easily integrate additional pages, content or functionality in your app, such as your Twitter feed, podcasting, image or video galleries. Get in touch at <a href="mailto:hello@mobiloud.com">hello@mobiloud.com!</a>

= Will you help me publish my app? =

Yes, we handle the messy Apple upload and submission process for you.

= Why should I use Mobiloud for my blog, rather than a mobile template? =

Mobiloud helps you build native apps, meaning it can draw on the full capabilities of modern smartphones. It's the best solution for a more responsive user experience. A native app allows users to receive push notifications, share with a single tap, quickly comment on articles and access content offline. It's like a newsletter on steroids.

= Can I use this plugin without a Mobiloud app? =

Yes, you are free to use this plugin with any app. The Mobiloud plugin lets you use REST calls and provides JSON output to expose your blog’s content to any application. Unfortunately we cannot support you or providing documentation.
