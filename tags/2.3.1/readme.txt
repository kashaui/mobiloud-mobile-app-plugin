Create real native mobile apps for iPhone, iPad and Android with your WordPress site. No coding required.

== Description ==

= Build native mobile apps with Wordpress in one click. No effort required. =

Mobiloud is a premium WordPress plugin and mobile app publishing service. It's for publishers and bloggers who want to build a branded **native mobile apps** for iOS and Android, offering content from their WordPress site (similar apps are published by TechCrunch, The Verge, The Huffington Post). **Note it's not a free service** (check out the [pricing](http://www.mobiloud.com/pricing.php?ref=plugindesc)). If it sounds like what you want, and it should, then read on.

Mobiloud apps are fast, run smoothly and their design is specific to the platform you run them on, be it iOS or Android (this is not the case with any other competitor). The apps support **mobile ad networks** such as Admob and Adsense, allow you to add your own advertising, support **WordPress, Disqus and Facebook comments** and allow you to **automatically send push notifications** when you publish new content.

We're a team of app developers, so we can provide you with further **customisation for your apps and more functionality** as required. If you're site has more functionality then a blog and you want it available on the app, then just let us know what you need. If you're an agency or developer, you can resell Mobilouds apps to your customers, without any Mobiloud branding.

Install the plugin now and you will be moments away from creating your mobile app.

= Build your own native iOS and Android apps =
Smartphones and tablets are outselling PCs 4:1. Chances are you're getting 30-40% of your traffic from mobile devices today, rest assured, by 2015 it will be 50-60%. In short, **you need to be on mobile if you want to be where your readers are**.

**Mobile users spend 85% of their time inside apps** - it's clear apps have won user's hearts more than the mobile web. People love the simplicty, speed and comfort apps can offer. 

= No programming necessary =
With Mobiloud, you can create apps without any of the programming hassle. With Mobiloud, it's a **one-click process**, and we help you with getting the design exactly as you want. This is **your branded mobile app**, so make it yours!  

= Native mobile user experience =
Your app built on Mobiloud is a **real native mobile app**. It will offer a clean, professional design, easy swipe actions to navigate your content and one-tap access to features like favourite articles, commenting and sharing. Mobiloud apps are nothing like what our competitors offer, which are generally slow, poorly designed apps made with HTML and close to zero native code. The difference is clear.

= Have your visitors come back, again and again! =
With your own mobile app, you can convert visitors into loyal app users that stick and come back to your app and content. It's like a newsletter on steroids. **Send push notifications** to bring your mobile users back and keep them engaged.

= Increase your mobile traffic =
Mobile app users tend to consume on average more content every time they load an app, compared to a desktop or mobile site (we see 5x more views/visit on apps). Your mobile app will also be featured in the App Store and Google's Play Store, giving you access to millions of mobile app users from right around the world.

= Make money with mobile advertising =
We support Google's Admob and Adsense out of the box, and a number of other networks, but you can add any HTML code to display your banners!

= Make it simple to share your content =
To grow your site and business, sharing is everything. It's like free marketing! And with your mobile app, you'll encourage **sharing with a single tap** via all social media sites, email or SMS – simple! We support all major social networks, Whatsapp, Readibility and Instapaper among other services.

= App analytics =
With support for Google Analytics, you will be able to **track downloads, usage, and other statistics**, so you’ll have complete visibility and transparency over the success of your mobile app.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How much does it cost? =
The Mobile App Plugin is free to install. You can also design your own app at no cost and with no risk. Once you have designed your app and would like to publish it on the App Store, we have simple pricing plans you can choose from. Check the [pricing plans on Mobiloud.com](http://www.mobiloud.com/pricing.php?ref=plugindesc).

= Does Mobiloud help me build a mobile site? =
We don't provide a mobile site together with your app. It's a good idea to have a mobile site, so casual visitors can still have a decent experience on your site when using a mobile device. Of course, we recommend you also build a mobile app, to convert those casual visitors into loyal followers, increase your traffic and keep growing your audience.

The following plugins are all compatible with Mobiloud: WP-Touch, WordPress Mobile Edition, WordPress Mobile Pack, Mobile Press.

= What functionality will my mobile app offer? =
Your app will automatically show the latest content from your site, with no need for you to update it manually. Your app will display posts and pages, comments and categories. Your users will be able to read content online and offline, share it with a single tap, save their favourites, leave comments on your articles and, most importantly, receive push notifications alerting them to new content.

= Can I test out my app online before I buy? =
Yes, after installing the plugin and signing up you'll be able to test your app. Even before that, you can try our [example application](http://www.mobiloud.com/demo.php?ref=plugindesc) to get a feel of how Mobiloud apps work.

= Can I try an example app on my iPhone or iPad? =
Sure, we have published many apps you can try directly. Just open up App Store on your phone or iPad and search for *Speckyboy*.

= Can I have advertising on my app? =
Of course! We support **Admob and Adwords**, out of the box. You can also add your own code for any kind of HTML banners.

= Can you add more functionality to the app? =
Yes, we can easily integrate additional content or functionality in your app, such as your Twitter feed, podcast, image or video galleries. Get in touch at [hello@mobiloud.com](mailto:hello@mobiloud.com) to get a quote.

= Can you design my app for me? =
Yes, we offer a VIP setup option which includes icon and app design, with 2 revisions from our designers. Just email us at [design@mobiloud.com](mailto:design@mobiloud.com) for a quote.

= Why should I build a mobile app for my blog? =
More and more, people are choosing to use their smartphones and tablets to read online content. Not only these devices make reading more comfortable, which explains why people prefer them to PCs, but there are now millions of mobile users who have just started accessing online content, as they never really used a PC before. On these mobile devices, users spend 80% of their time on apps. So no wonder, they expect to find your content in the form of a mobile app!

With a mobile app you'll be able to convert casual visitors into loyal followers. Why? Because your app will be front and center, easily accessible from the home screen of their device. And because you can alert with push notifications whenever you post something new.

= What is a native mobile app? =
Mobiloud apps, on every platform, are native mobile apps. Most competing solutions instead give you HTML5 apps, which means really mobile sites re-packaged as apps. The big difference is in performance and user experience.

Native apps are fast, run smoothly on the devices they are designed for, and make full use of each platform's capabilities. They're also easier to use, because they're designed to look and feel familiar on each mobile platform, be it iOS or Android. A Mobiloud app allows your users to receive push notifications, share with a single tap, quickly comment on articles and access content offline. In short, if you want to impress your users, go native and build a real mobile app!

= Can I use Disqus or Facebook comments? =
Yes, you can use Disqus or Facebook for comments on your app to replace the standard Wordpress commenting system.

= Can I use my own Apple account? =
Yes, we recommend you register your own Apple developer account, though it's not requried. You can get yours [here](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/).

= Is there a long term contract? =
No contracts here! You pay month-to-month, and if you're unhappy with the service, you can simply cancel by emailing us at [support@mobiloud.com](mailto:support@mobiloud.com). Simple. No risk.

= What are the Terms and Conditions? =
Here is our [Terms and Conditions](http://www.mobiloud.com/terms.php?ref=plugindesc) and [Privacy Policy](http://www.mobiloud.com/privacy.php?ref=plugindesc).
