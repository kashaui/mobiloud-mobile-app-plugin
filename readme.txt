Beautiful mobile apps for your WordPress blog or news site.

== Description ==

**Mobiloud is a premium (paid) service that allows publishers and bloggers to turn their WordPress site into a beautifully stylish mobile app. 

Mobiloud is easy to use, with no coding required. It's also the only real native app solution exclusively dedicated to WordPress.**

2 billion smartphone users today spend 85% of their time on their devices using apps. If you don't have an app to complement your web presence, you're missing on a huge opportunity to reach new and existing readers.

**Mobiloud is designed just for you, a simple and well designed mobile application for your WordPress blog or news site.**

Unlike other solutions, Mobiloud gives you a completely "native" app. Native apps look and feel great on Android and iOS, and don't have the sluggish and glitchy behaviour of non-native apps. Support for Android Wear smartwatches and Apple Watch is coming soon!

With Mobiloud, real native mobile apps are affordable ([prices](http://www.mobiloud.com/pricing/?ref=plugindesc) start at $89/month), and you won’t need any programming skills to get your app published - we take care of build and publication for you!

Install the plugin now and you will be moments away from creating your own mobile app.

**Note the plugin is free to use to design, manage and preview your apps, but getting your apps built and published on App Store and Google Play is a paid service ([prices here](http://www.mobiloud.com/pricing/?ref=plugindesc))**

For any questions, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us at [support@mobiloud.com](mailto:support@mobiloud.com)

**Who Mobiloud is for:**

* Professional online publishers
* Online magazines, high traffic news websites
* Professional bloggers, podcasters
* Content-rich websites using posts or custom post types for their content
* Lovers of great apps and design

**Who it is *NOT* a good fit for:**

* People looking for a mobile site tool or template
* Company sites with no blog or content
* WooCommerce or Buddypress websites
* Heavily customised websites that look nothing like what WordPress was built for
* Those who like slow, clunky apps


= What you get with Mobiloud =

* **Your WordPress site instantly converted into real mobile apps**. The Mobiloud WordPress plugin will automatically feed your app with your latest content. Any new articles will be listed in the app as soon as they're published; changes to your app's menu and configuration will be instantly made available. With Mobiloud, you publish your content from your WordPress site, with the convenience of having your app automatically updated. No extra work required.

* **Customise your app with your style and brand**. It's your own app, so customise it with your own colors, add your logo, create a custom icon and launch image, and with your content in there, it will be unique!

* **Fast, smooth and well designed native mobile apps**. iPhone, iPad, Android phones and tablets are all supported. Mobiloud apps are designed according to the latest mobile design trends and following iOS and Android design guidelines. It means you get apps which look and feel great and offer the best user experience possible: users intuitively know how to navigate your content in the app and will be amazed by the design. [Try our demo](http://www.mobiloud.com/demo/?ref=plugindesc)

* **Publish your apps on App Store and Google Play**. We take care of the tedious app submission for you, so you don't have to worry about signing up as a developer, paying for a developer account and handling the build and submission process. But if you care to do it yourself, we're ok with that too (you can use your own account and receive binaries for the app).

* **Use push notifications to bring people back to your content, send alerts and reach out to your users**. Mobile apps and push notifications are the best tool to build an audience on mobile. Think of it like a newsletter on steroids (open rates for push are close to 90%, compare that with email!). With Mobiloud you can send notifications automatically whenever you post new content (with optional filters) or manually, whenever you want. You can also attach a page or post to your notification, so you can use them for anything: alert your users to a new event, promotion or send urgent and important updates - it's a direct connection with your users!

* **MoPub, Google DFP, Admob, Adsense and other mobile advertising options**. We support HTML/Javascript/iframe ad units you can embed directly in your content (you're free to fit them wherever within articles/pages). Banner ads, interstitials and native ads are all supported with our MoPub and Google DFP integration.

* **WordPress, Disqus and Facebook comments**. It doesn't matter what you use - your app will store your user's details so they can comment on your content in one tap!

* **Easy social sharing options for your users**. To grow your site and business, sharing is everything. It's like free marketing! And with your mobile app, you'll encourage sharing with a single tap via all social media sites, email or SMS – simple! We support all major social networks, Whatsapp, Readibility and Instapaper among other services.

* **Analytics**. With support for **Google Analytics** to track traffic on your app, you'll have a full view on how people use your app and what content works best.

* **Advanced feautures** including support for custom post types, image galleries, an advanced Editor you an use to add your own HTML/CSS/PHP code to customise the article/page screens or add custom fields, support for subscriptions/membership sites and much more.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How much does it cost? =
The Mobile App Plugin is free to install. You can also design your own app at no cost and with no risk. Once you have designed your app and would like to publish it on the App Store or Google Play, we have simple pricing plans you can choose from. Check the [pricing plans on Mobiloud.com](http://www.mobiloud.com/pricing/?ref=plugindesc).

= Does Mobiloud help me build a mobile site? =
We don't provide a mobile site together with your app. It's a good idea to have a mobile site, so casual visitors can still have a decent experience on your site when using a mobile device. Of course, we recommend you also build a mobile app, to convert those casual visitors into loyal followers, increase your traffic and keep growing your audience.

The following plugins are all compatible with Mobiloud: Wptouch, WordPress Mobile Edition, WordPress Mobile Pack, Mobile Press.

= What functionality will my mobile app offer? =
Your app will automatically show the latest content from your site, with no need for you to update it manually. Your app will display posts and pages, comments and categories. Your users will be able to read content online and offline, share it with a single tap, save their favourites, leave comments on your articles and, most importantly, receive push notifications alerting them to new content.

= Can I test out my app online before I buy? =
Yes, after installing the plugin and signing up you'll be able to test your app. Even before that, you can try our [demo application](http://www.mobiloud.com/demo/?ref=plugindesc) to get a feel of how Mobiloud apps work.

= Can I try an example app on my iPhone or iPad? =
Sure, we have published many apps you can try directly. Just open up App Store on your phone or iPad and search for *Speckyboy*.

= Can I have advertising on my app? =
Of course! We support **Admob and Adwords**, out of the box. You can also add your own code for any kind of HTML banners.

= Can you add more functionality to the app? =
Yes, we can easily integrate additional content or functionality in your app, such as your Twitter feed, podcast, image or video galleries. Get in touch at [hello@mobiloud.com](mailto:hello@mobiloud.com) to get a quote.

= Can you design my app for me? =
Yes, we offer a VIP setup option which includes icon and app design, with 2 revisions from our designers. Just email us at [design@mobiloud.com](mailto:design@mobiloud.com) for a quote.

= Why should I build a mobile app for my blog? =
More and more, people are choosing to use their smartphones and tablets to read online content. Not only these devices make reading more comfortable, which explains why people prefer them to PCs, but there are now millions of mobile users who have just started accessing online content, as they never really used a PC before. On these mobile devices, users spend 80% of their time on apps. So no wonder, they expect to find your content in the form of a mobile app!

With a mobile app you'll be able to convert casual visitors into loyal followers. Why? Because your app will be front and center, easily accessible from the home screen of their device. And because you can alert with push notifications whenever you post something new.

= What is a native mobile app? =
Mobiloud apps, on every platform, are native mobile apps. Most competing solutions instead give you HTML5 apps, which means really mobile sites re-packaged as apps. The big difference is in performance and user experience.

Native apps are fast, run smoothly on the devices they are designed for, and make full use of each platform's capabilities. They're also easier to use, because they're designed to look and feel familiar on each mobile platform, be it iOS or Android. A Mobiloud app allows your users to receive push notifications, share with a single tap, quickly comment on articles and access content offline. In short, if you want to impress your users, go native and build a real mobile app!

= Can I use Disqus or Facebook comments? =
Yes, you can use Disqus or Facebook for comments on your app to replace the standard Wordpress commenting system.

= Can I use my own Apple or Google Play account? =
Yes, we recommend you register your own Apple developer account, though it's not requried. You can get yours [here](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/).

= Is there a long term contract? =
No contracts here! You pay month-to-month, and if you're unhappy with the service, you can simply cancel by emailing us at [support@mobiloud.com](mailto:support@mobiloud.com). Simple. No risk.

= What are the Terms and Conditions? =
Here is our [Terms and Conditions](http://www.mobiloud.com/terms/?ref=plugindesc) and [Privacy Policy](http://www.mobiloud.com/privacy/?ref=plugindesc).

= Where are you based? =
We're a UK company based in London. Mobiloud a trademark of Fifty Pixels Ltd. Come meet us at Clerkenwell Workshops, 31 Clerkenwell Close, London, EC1R 0AT.
