Make your content shine with iPhone and iPad apps for your blog.

== Description ==

= Perfect apps for your blog. =
If you're not mobile, you're missing an opportunity. The Mobiloud platform allows us to create a custom, full-featured mobile app for your blog at an affordable price and in a short timeframe (3-4 weeks). Try a demo or request pricing at <a href="http://www.mobiloud.com">Mobiloud.com</a>.

= Beautiful, fast, easy to use. =
Mobiloud apps run on iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad with a simple to use but beautifully designed interface that can be completely customised to your taste and style. Readers enjoy apps with a smooth, responsive user experience, offline access to your content and push notifications. A fast native interface lets your readers comment on your posts, as easy as using the SMS app, helping you further build your community on mobile (we even integrated Facebook login to make commenting even faster).

= Grow your traffic, build a loyal following. =
Watch your traffic grow as you take full advantage of the App Store for distribution and your users read more of your content thanks to quick, smooth access to your articles (more articles are just a swipe away). Push notifications allow you to keep them engaged with your content more effectively than any other subscription mechanism. Similarly to a newsletter, with a mobile app you can finally convert casual visitors into loyal readers. Better then a newsletter, your readers access your content from a distraction-free mobile device and can keep browsing your articles to read more.

= Make more money. =
Native mobile ads generate on average 3x the click-through rates than standard web advertising. Other opportunities to monetise your apps include paid downloads, subscriptions or in-app purchase for premium content.

= Great value. =
Our pricing is based on a flat setup fee and a monthly service fee covering license costs, unlimited push notifications, support and unlimited app updates. We have no long term contracts and you can cancel anytime.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it free? =

Yes, the Mobiloud Mobile App Plugin is free to use.

= I have the plugin, what about the app? =

Just as your blog or website should present your content through an identifiable design, it is important to ensure that your mobile app reflects the same look and feel. Mobiloud apps are designed and developed on an individual basis according to your design specifications and needs. More information on our service is available at www.mobiloud.com.

= Can I use this plugin without a Mobiloud app? =

Yes, you are free to use this plugin with any app. The Mobiloud plugin lets you use REST calls and provides JSON output to expose your blog’s content to any application. For documentation, refer to our website.

= Can I use the push notification service with my app? =

The push notification service offered is not exclusive to Mobiloud apps. You can request an account at push@50pixels.com. We provide a free hosted service allowing you to send unlimited push notifications to iOS devices, subject to fair usage limits. Simple APIs allow you to connect to our remote service with a few lines of code.

= Why should I use Mobiloud for my blog, rather than a mobile template? =

Mobiloud is a native app, meaning it can draw on the full capabilities of modern smartphones. It's the optimal solution for a more responsive user experience, with smoother screen transitions and higher performance than web-based templates.

Unlike web templates, Mobiloud also allows you to:

- Promote your app on the App Store - a great way to exponentially increase readership

- Sync your content to user's phones for offline viewing

- Use push notifications to alert your users to new content - even when the app isn't open

Using the Mobiloud platform we can quickly and efficiently provide native apps for your blog or brand at an affordable price, mitigating the usual disadvantages of going native.

= I've found a bug, would you like to provide feedback or have a suggestion. =
