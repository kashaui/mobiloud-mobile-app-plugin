Publish native mobile apps for your site in 5 minutes.

== Description ==

**[Mobiloud](http://www.mobiloud.com/?ref=plugindesc) is a premium service designed to convert your WordPress site into a native mobile app for iOS and Android. Mobiloud is easy to use, with no coding required.**

**Unlike other solutions, Mobiloud gives you a completely "native" mobile app**. Native mobile apps look and feel great on Android and iOS, and don't have the sluggish and glitchy behaviour of non-native apps.

With Mobiloud, native mobile apps are finally affordable, **and you won’t need any programming skills to get your app published - we take care of the app build and submission for you**.

= Pricing =
Install the plugin and design your mobile app for free. Try it as long as you want. Test it online and on your own device. To publish your app on App Store or Google Play, we charge affordable fees. Check the [pricing plans on Mobiloud.com](http://www.mobiloud.com/publish/?ref=plugindesc).

For any questions, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us at [support@mobiloud.com](mailto:support@mobiloud.com).

= What you get with Mobiloud =

* **Your WordPress site quickly converted into real mobile apps**. The Mobiloud WordPress plugin will automatically feed your app with your latest content. Any new articles will be listed in the app as soon as they're published; changes to your app's menu and configuration will be instantly made available. With Mobiloud, you publish your content from your WordPress site, with the convenience of having your app automatically updated. No extra work required.

* **Customise your app with your style and brand**. It's your own app, so customise it with your own colors, add your logo, create a custom icon and launch image, and with your content in there, it will be unique!

* **Fast, smooth and well designed native mobile apps**. iPhone, iPad, Android phones and tablets are all supported. Mobiloud apps are designed according to the latest mobile design trends and following iOS and Android design guidelines. It means you get apps which look and feel great and offer the best user experience possible: users intuitively know how to navigate your content in the app and will be amazed by the design. [Try our demo](http://www.mobiloud.com/demo/?ref=plugindesc)

* **Publish your apps on App Store and Google Play**. We take care of the tedious app submission for you, so you don't have to worry about signing up as a developer, paying for a developer account and handling the build and submission process. But if you care to do it yourself, we're ok with that too (you can use your own account and receive binaries for the app).

* **Use push notifications to bring people back to your content, send alerts and reach out to your users**. Mobile apps and push notifications are the best tool to build an audience on mobile. Think of it like a newsletter on steroids (open rates for push are close to 90%, compare that with email!). With Mobiloud you can send notifications automatically whenever you post new content (with optional filters) or manually, whenever you want. You can also attach a page or post to your notification, so you can use them for anything: alert your users to a new event, promotion or send urgent and important updates - it's a direct connection with your users!

* **MoPub, Google DFP, Admob, Adsense and other mobile advertising options**. We support HTML/Javascript/iframe ad units you can embed directly in your content (you're free to fit them wherever within articles/pages). Banner ads, interstitials and native ads are all supported with our MoPub and Google DFP integration.

* **WordPress, Disqus and Facebook comments**. It doesn't matter what you use - your app will store your user's details so they can comment on your content in one tap!

* **Easy social sharing options for your users**. To grow your site and business, sharing is everything. It's like free marketing! And with your mobile app, you'll encourage sharing with a single tap via all social media sites, email or SMS – simple! We support all major social networks, Whatsapp, Readibility and Instapaper among other services.

* **Analytics**. With support for **Google Analytics** to track traffic on your app, you'll have a full view on how people use your app and what content works best.

* **Support for WordPress features** such as custom post types, custom fields, tags, categories, custom taxonomies and most WordPress plugins (some customisation might be required).

* **Advanced feautures** including an advanced Editor you an use to add your own HTML/CSS/PHP code to customise the article/page screens or add custom fields, support for subscriptions/membership sites and much more.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a native mobile app? =
Mobiloud apps, on every platform, are native mobile apps. Most competing solutions instead give you HTML5 apps, which means really mobile sites re-packaged as apps. The big difference is in performance and user experience.

Native apps are fast, run smoothly on the devices they are designed for, and make full use of each platform's capabilities. They're also easier to use, because they're designed to look and feel familiar on each mobile platform, be it iOS or Android. A Mobiloud app allows your users to receive push notifications, share with a single tap, quickly comment on articles and access content offline. In short, if you want to impress your users, go native and build a real mobile app!

= Why should I build a mobile app for my blog? =
More and more, people are choosing to use their smartphones and tablets to read online content. Not only these devices make reading more comfortable, which explains why people prefer them to PCs, but there are now millions of mobile users who have just started accessing online content, as they never really used a PC before. On these mobile devices, users spend 80% of their time on apps. So no wonder, they expect to find your content in the form of a mobile app!

With a mobile app you'll be able to convert casual visitors into loyal followers. Why? Because your app will be front and center, easily accessible from the home screen of their device. And because you can alert with push notifications whenever you post something new.

= How much does it cost? =
The Mobile App Plugin is free to install. You can design your app and test it online and your own device, for free. Once you're happy with the result and would like to publish it on the App Store or Google Play, we have simple pricing plans you can choose from. Check the [pricing plans on Mobiloud.com](http://www.mobiloud.com/publish/?ref=plugindesc).

= Is there a quick demo? =
Yes, check out our [demo page](http://www.mobiloud.com/demo/).

= Can I test out my app before I buy? =
Yes, after installing the plugin you'll be able to test your own app on your device. You can also get a quick preview in a simulator.

= Can I try an example app on my iPhone or iPad? =
Sure, we have published many apps you can try directly. Just open up App Store on your phone or iPad and search for *Speckyboy*.

= What functionality will my mobile app offer? =
Your app will automatically show the latest content from your site, with no need for you to update it manually. Your app will display posts and pages, comments and categories. Your users will be able to read content online and offline, share it with a single tap, save their favourites, leave comments on your articles and, most importantly, receive push notifications alerting them to new content.

= Are push notifications supported? = 
With Mobiloud you can send notifications automatically whenever you post new content (with optional filters) or manually, whenever you want. You can also attach a page or post to your notification, so you can use them for anything: alert your users to a new event, promotion or send urgent and important updates - it's a direct connection with your users!

= Can I show my pages or an external URL in the app? =
Your site is built with pages rather than articles? No problem, you can set a page as your app's home screen, add pages to the app's menu and allow your users to easily navigate a whole hierarchy of pages. Use it to build apps for a company site, catalogues and any sort of reference apps.

Beyond pages and articles, you can now use any URL as your app's home screen or as an entry in your app's menu. Use it to embed functionality from any web app into your app, like forms, widgets or your profile on social networks, the possibilities are endless!

= Are image galleries supported? =
Image galleries are supported natively, with a simple design that enhances your photography and lets the user quickly browse your images.

Users can swipe between images, save or share them and quickly get an overview of all the images you attached to your articles.

= Can I modify the code or add my own CSS? =
Sure, click on Settings/Editor to add your own HTML/PHP/CSS code and customise the contents and looks of your app's screens. You can easily pull in content from custom fields and add any functionality and styling adjustments you need.

= Are custom fields supported? =
Yes, you can easily add custom fields to the article list (one field supported) or anywhere and in any number within the content of posts or pages. You can add your own code using our Editor, or we can help you out.

= Can I show custom post types in the app? =
Yes, custom post types are supported, simply select which post types to show in the article list by adjusting the relevant options in the plugin Settings.

= Can I have advertising on my app? =
Of course! We support **MoPub, Google DFP, Admob and Adwords**, out of the box. You can also add your own code for any kind of HTML banners.

= Can you add more functionality to the app? =
Yes, we can easily integrate additional content or functionality in your app. Get in touch at [hello@mobiloud.com](mailto:hello@mobiloud.com) to get a quote.

= What languages are supported? =
Mobiloud apps are multi-language and support RTL for Arabic and Hebrew. We add language all the time, write us now to inquire about support for your own language.

Languages currently supported include: English, Arabic, French, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, German, Swedish and Portuguese. We add new ones all the time, as they're requested.

= Do you take care of the app submission? =
Yes, we handle the complicated submission process for you. But you can also do it yourself if you want to.

Would you like to submit your own app? That’s possible too.

= How long does it take to publish an app with Mobiloud? =
From your order to submitting the apps we take 5-10 business days. Note Apple then takes 5-10 business days to approve your app for the App Store. Publishing on Google Play requires generally about a day for the store to update.

= Can you design my app for me? =
Yes, we offer a VIP setup option which includes icon and app design, with 2 revisions from our designers. Just email us at [design@mobiloud.com](mailto:design@mobiloud.com) for a quote.

= Can I use Disqus or Facebook comments? =
Yes, you can use Disqus or Facebook for comments on your app in place of the standard WordPress commenting system.

= Does Mobiloud help me build a mobile site? =
We don't provide a mobile site together with your app. It's a good idea to have a mobile site, so casual visitors can still have a decent experience on your site when using a mobile device. Of course, we recommend you also build a mobile app, to convert those casual visitors into loyal followers, increase your traffic and keep growing your audience.

The following plugins are all compatible with Mobiloud: Wptouch, WordPress Mobile Edition, WordPress Mobile Pack, Mobile Press.

= Can I use my own Apple or Google Play account? =
Yes, we recommend you register your own Apple developer account, though it's not requried. You can get yours [here](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/).

= Is there a long term contract? =
No contracts here! You pay month-to-month, and if you're unhappy with the service, you can simply cancel by emailing us at [support@mobiloud.com](mailto:support@mobiloud.com). Simple. No risk.

= What are the Terms and Conditions? =
Here is our [Terms and Conditions](http://www.mobiloud.com/terms/?ref=plugindesc) and [Privacy Policy](http://www.mobiloud.com/privacy/?ref=plugindesc).

= Where are you based? =
