= The Benefits =
= Your brand on mobile =
With Mobiloud, you can create the mobile app you’ve always dreamed of without any of the programming hassle. It is incredibly easy to change the design of your launch screen, icon, and interface. This is **your branded app**, so make it really yours!

= Offer the best mobile user experience =
Your app will be a **real native app** (this is not a simple mobile site service). We're talking about a clean, shiny design, easy swipe actions to navigate your content and one-tap access to features like favourite articles, commenting and sharing.

= Your visitors will come back… again and again! =
With your own mobile app, you'll have new ways to engage and communicate with your readers. **Send push notifications** to bring your users back to new content and keep them engaged. You'll notice more repeated visits! 

= Increase your mobile traffic = 
App users tend to consume on average more content every time they load an app, compared to a desktop or mobile site. Your app will also be featured in the App Store and Google's Play Store, offering you access to millions of app users from right around the world.

= Make it really simple to share =
To grow your site and business, sharing is everything. It's like free marketing! And with your iPhone or iPad app, you'll encourage **sharing with a single tap** to social media sites or email – simple!

= Make money from your app =
We support Google's Admob out of the box, but you can use any ad server that outputs HTML code for your banners.

= App analytics =
With support for Google Analytics, you will be able to **track downloads, usage, and other statistics** in real time – so you’ll have complete visibility and transparency over the success of your mobile app.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin from the Plugin Directory, or by uploading the plugin to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu on WordPress.

3. Click on Get Started on the 'Mobiloud' menu page on your site, and start designing your app online. It only takes a few minutes.

4. You'll get to see a live preview of your app which you can test online (100% like what you'll publish).

5. Choose one of our plans and publish your app on the App Store (we do all the work for you!)


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have the plugin, how do I get my app? =

Find the 'Mobiloud' tab on your Wordpress admin menu, enter your details and click on Get Started. Start designing your app online. It only takes a few minutes. You'll get a live preview of your app, which will look 100% like the app we'll publish for you on App Store. More information on our service is available at <a href="http://www.mobiloud.com?ref=plugin">http://www.mobiloud.com</a>.

= How much is the service? =

The Mobile App Plugin is free to install. You can also design your own app at no cost and with no risk. 

Once you have designed your app and would like to publish it on the App Store, we have two simple plans. <strong>Professional</strong>, at $49/month, gets you an iPhone app and up to 1,000 push notifications a month. Our <strong>Publisher</strong> plan, at $69 a month, gives you an iPhone and iPad app and unlimited push notifications. Support and maintenance are included in both plans.

= What functionality will my app offer? =

Your app will gather content automatically from your Wordpress site, display posts and pages and optionally your Twitter and Facebook profile's content. Your users will be able to read content online and offline, share it with a single tap, save their favourites, leave comments on your articles and receive push notifications alerting them to new content.

= Can you add more functionality to the app? =

Sure, we can easily integrate additional pages, content or functionality in your app, such as your Twitter feed, podcasting, image or video galleries. Get in touch at <a href="mailto:hello@mobiloud.com">hello@mobiloud.com!</a>

= Will you help me publish my app? =

Yes, we handle the messy Apple upload and submission process for you.

= Why should I use Mobiloud for my blog, rather than a mobile template? =

Mobiloud helps you build native apps, meaning it can draw on the full capabilities of modern smartphones. It's the best solution for a more responsive user experience. A native app allows users to receive push notifications, share with a single tap, quickly comment on articles and access content offline. It's like a newsletter on steroids.

= Can I use this plugin without a Mobiloud app? =

Yes, you are free to use this plugin with any app. The Mobiloud plugin lets you use REST calls and provides JSON output to expose your blog’s content to any application. Unfortunately we cannot support you or providing documentation.
